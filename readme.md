## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate researcher working in **autonomous road safety**, methodologically in a geospatial time series data-driven way. 

My research aims at **safer traffic for all modes of road users by automated technologies**, including but not limited to automated vehicles, data-empowered traffic monitoring, and data-driven infrastructure&policy improvement. My digital CV is avaiable at https://yiru-jiao.github.io -- which is very bibliometrically formed for HR's or quantitative eyes.

I have a mixed education background in Operations Research and Managament Information Systems; as a result, I'm generally interested in collective patterns emerged in individual interactions, of which the curiousity also motivated me to pursue a PhD degree. I'm currently in the last year and approaching the end of my PhD journey in TU Delft. My doctoral research is about road user interactions. Most of my papers published during PhD are openly accessible thanks to TU Delft Library. Each paper is with relevant code repos open-sourced here in GitHub. Below is a more detailed list where we
